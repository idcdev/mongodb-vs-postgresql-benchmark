# Phase 2: Standard Benchmarks

This document details the implementation plan for Phase 2 of the MongoDB vs PostgreSQL Benchmark project.

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on implementing standard benchmarks for common database operations, providing a solid foundation for comparisons between MongoDB and PostgreSQL. The goal is to create a comprehensive set of tests that cover real-world usage scenarios.

## Objectives

1. Develop benchmarks for basic CRUD operations
2. Implement benchmarks for complex queries
3. Create benchmarks for bulk operations
4. Test aggregation and analysis operations
5. Compare transactional performance
6. Evaluate indexing efficiency

## Implementation Approach

**Updated Approach (March 2024):** 

We have revised our implementation approach to first establish a complete end-to-end workflow with the benchmarks we've already implemented, before continuing to add more benchmark types. This allows us to:

1. Validate the architecture with real-world usage
2. Get early feedback on benchmark results
3. Establish a solid foundation for adding more benchmarks
4. Enable users to run basic benchmarks while development continues

Our current priorities are:
1. Complete the benchmark execution framework
2. Configure database adapters for real MongoDB and PostgreSQL testing
3. Implement visualization and reporting
4. Build a user-friendly CLI interface

After establishing this end-to-end flow, we will return to implementing the remaining benchmark types in the original plan.

## Current Progress

| Benchmark Category | Status | Details |
|-------------------|--------|---------|
| Creation Operations | 75% Complete | Single insertion ✅ Batch insertion ✅ Validated insertion ✅ |
| Read Operations | 25% Complete | Query by ID ✅ Multiple criteria ❌ Pagination ❌ |
| Update Operations | Not Started | |
| Delete Operations | Not Started | |
| Complex Queries | Not Started | |
| Bulk Operations | Not Started | |
| Aggregation | Not Started | |
| Transactions | Not Started | |
| Indexing | Not Started | |

## Benchmark Structure

Each benchmark will be implemented following a consistent structure:

```typescript
import { BaseBenchmark } from '../core/domain/model/base-benchmark';
import { BenchmarkOptions } from '../core/domain/model/benchmark-options';
import { DatabaseAdapter } from '../core/domain/interfaces/database-adapter.interface';

export class OperationNameBenchmark extends BaseBenchmark {
  constructor(options: BenchmarkOptions) {
    super('operation-name', options);
  }

  async setup(adapter: DatabaseAdapter): Promise<void> {
    // Environment preparation
  }

  async execute(adapter: DatabaseAdapter): Promise<void> {
    // Execution of the operation to be measured
  }

  async teardown(adapter: DatabaseAdapter): Promise<void> {
    // Cleanup after the benchmark
  }
}
```

## Benchmark Parameters

To ensure fair comparisons between MongoDB and PostgreSQL, each benchmark will use configurable parameters:

- Dataset size
- Document/record complexity
- Number of repetitions
- Parallelism settings
- Database-specific options

## Expected Results

Each benchmark will produce standardized results including:

- Average execution time
- Throughput (operations per second)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)
- Direct comparisons between MongoDB and PostgreSQL

## Test Cases

To validate the accuracy and reproducibility of benchmarks, tests will be implemented for:

- Result accuracy
- Consistency across multiple executions
- Behavior under different loads
- Comparability between databases

## Next Steps

1. Implement basic operation benchmarks (CRUD)
2. Develop benchmarks for complex queries
3. Create benchmarks for bulk operations
4. Implement aggregation benchmarks
5. Add transactional benchmarks
6. Develop indexing benchmarks
