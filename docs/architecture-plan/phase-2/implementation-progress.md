# Phase 2: Standard Benchmarks - Implementation Progress

## Current Status

**Progress**: 40% Complete

The implementation of Phase 2 is focused on creating a comprehensive suite of standard benchmarks for MongoDB and PostgreSQL. This phase builds on the architectural foundation established in Phase 1.

## Implementation Tracking

### Basic Operations

| Benchmark | Status | Test Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Single Document Insertion | âœ… Completed | 100% | Includes performance metrics for individual document insertion |
| Batch Insertion | âœ… Completed | 100% | Tests different batch sizes for optimal performance |
| Validated Insertion | âœ… Completed | 100% | Tests performance with document validation rules |
| Single Document Query | âœ… Completed | 100% | Tests performance of querying documents by ID |
| Multiple Document Query | ðŸ”„ Postponed | 0% | Postponed to focus on end-to-end implementation |
| Document Update | ðŸ”„ Postponed | 0% | Postponed to focus on end-to-end implementation |
| Document Deletion | ðŸ”„ Postponed | 0% | Postponed to focus on end-to-end implementation |

### Complex Queries

### End-to-End Implementation

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Benchmark Registration | âœ… Completed | Created utility to register all benchmarks with the BenchmarkService |
| CLI Runner | âœ… Completed | Implemented CLI with commands for running and inspecting benchmarks |
| Database Integration | âœ… Completed | Integrated with real MongoDB and PostgreSQL instances |
| Results Visualization | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Basic console output implemented, JSON file storage in progress |

## Test Coverage

Total Test Coverage: 30%

The following benchmarks have comprehensive test suites:
- `SingleDocumentInsertionBenchmark`: Unit tests cover all main functionality
- `BatchInsertionBenchmark`: Unit tests cover all main functionality
- `ValidatedInsertionBenchmark`: Unit tests cover all main functionality
- `SingleDocumentQueryBenchmark`: Unit tests cover all main functionality

## Project Metrics

- Implemented Benchmarks: 4 of 25 (16%)
- End-to-End Components: 3 of 4 (75%)
- Lines of Code: ~2,500
- Number of Tests: 50+

## Next Steps

1. ~~Implement the `MultipleDocumentQueryBenchmark` for querying multiple records~~ (Postponed)
2. ~~Implement `FilteredQueryBenchmark` for more complex query operations~~ (Postponed)
3. **Complete the end-to-end implementation with existing benchmarks**
   - âœ… Create benchmark registration utility
   - âœ… Integrate with real database instances
   - âœ… Implement CLI interface for running benchmarks
   - ðŸ”„ Enhance results visualization and reporting
