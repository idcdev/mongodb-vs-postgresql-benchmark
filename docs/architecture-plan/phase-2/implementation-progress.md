## Project Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Test coverage | 10% |
| Benchmarks defined | 45 |
| Benchmarks implemented | 2 |
| Benchmarks tested | 2 |

## Next Steps

1. Implement ValidatedInsertionBenchmark for testing data validation
2. Begin implementing read operation benchmarks (ReadByIdBenchmark)
3. Integrate with BenchmarkService for running benchmarks
4. Add integration tests with real databases
5. Create benchmarks for complex query operations
