# Phase 2: Standard Benchmarks - Implementation Progress

## Current Status

**Progress**: 20% Complete

The implementation of Phase 2 is focused on creating a comprehensive suite of standard benchmarks for MongoDB and PostgreSQL. This phase builds on the architectural foundation established in Phase 1.

## Test Coverage

Total Test Coverage: 20%

The following benchmarks have comprehensive test suites:
- `SingleDocumentInsertionBenchmark`: Unit tests cover all main functionality
- `BatchInsertionBenchmark`: Unit tests cover all main functionality
- `ValidatedInsertionBenchmark`: Unit tests cover all main functionality
- `SingleDocumentQueryBenchmark`: Unit tests cover all main functionality

## Project Metrics

- Implemented Benchmarks: 4 of 25 (16%)
- Lines of Code: ~1,700
- Number of Tests: 50+

## Next Steps

1. Implement the `MultipleDocumentQueryBenchmark` for querying multiple records
2. Implement `FilteredQueryBenchmark` for more complex query operations
3. Integrate the benchmarks with the `BenchmarkService`
4. Create integration tests with actual MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases
