# Phase 2: Standard Benchmarks - Implementation Progress

## Current Status

**Progress**: 25% Complete

The implementation of Phase 2 is focused on creating a comprehensive suite of standard benchmarks for MongoDB and PostgreSQL. This phase builds on the architectural foundation established in Phase 1.

## Implementation Tracking

### Basic Operations

| Benchmark | Status | Test Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Single Document Insertion | ✅ Completed | 100% | Includes performance metrics for individual document insertion |
| Batch Insertion | ✅ Completed | 100% | Tests different batch sizes for optimal performance |
| Validated Insertion | ✅ Completed | 100% | Tests performance with document validation rules |
| Single Document Query | ✅ Completed | 100% | Tests performance of querying documents by ID |
| Multiple Document Query | 🔄 Postponed | 0% | Postponed to focus on end-to-end implementation |
| Document Update | 🔄 Postponed | 0% | Postponed to focus on end-to-end implementation |
| Document Deletion | 🔄 Postponed | 0% | Postponed to focus on end-to-end implementation |

### Complex Queries

| Benchmark | Status | Test Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Range Queries | 🔄 Postponed | 0% | Postponed to focus on end-to-end implementation |
| Text Search | 🔄 Postponed | 0% | Postponed to focus on end-to-end implementation |
| Geospatial Queries | 🔄 Postponed | 0% | Postponed to focus on end-to-end implementation |
| Nested Document Queries | 🔄 Postponed | 0% | Postponed to focus on end-to-end implementation |

### End-to-End Implementation

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Benchmark Registration | 🔄 In Progress | Creating utility to register all benchmarks with the BenchmarkService |
| CLI Runner | 🔄 In Progress | Implementing a simple CLI to run benchmarks |
| Database Integration | 📝 Planned | Connecting to real MongoDB and PostgreSQL instances |
| Results Visualization | 📝 Planned | Creating simple reports from benchmark results |

## Test Coverage

Total Test Coverage: 25%

The following benchmarks have comprehensive test suites:
- `SingleDocumentInsertionBenchmark`: Unit tests cover all main functionality
- `BatchInsertionBenchmark`: Unit tests cover all main functionality
- `ValidatedInsertionBenchmark`: Unit tests cover all main functionality
- `SingleDocumentQueryBenchmark`: Unit tests cover all main functionality

## Project Metrics

- Implemented Benchmarks: 4 of 25 (16%)
- Lines of Code: ~1,700
- Number of Tests: 50+

## Next Steps

1. ~~Implement the `MultipleDocumentQueryBenchmark` for querying multiple records~~ (Postponed)
2. ~~Implement `FilteredQueryBenchmark` for more complex query operations~~ (Postponed)
3. **Complete the end-to-end implementation with existing benchmarks**
   - Finish the benchmark registration utility
   - Complete the CLI runner implementation
   - Integrate with real database instances
   - Implement basic results visualization
