# ADR-001: Adoption of TypeScript

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The MongoDB vs PostgreSQL Benchmark project is being redesigned to follow a more robust and maintainable architecture. The current implementation uses JavaScript without type definitions, which can lead to:

- Runtime errors that could be caught at compile time
- Difficulty in understanding interfaces between components
- Challenges when refactoring code
- Limited IDE support for code navigation and autocompletion

As part of the architectural overhaul, we need to decide whether to continue with plain JavaScript or adopt TypeScript.

## Decision

We will adopt TypeScript for the entire codebase going forward. This includes:

1. Migrating existing code to TypeScript
2. Writing all new code in TypeScript
3. Setting up proper TypeScript configuration with strict type checking

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Improved reliability**: Static type checking will catch many errors at compile time
- **Better developer experience**: Enhanced IDE support with autocompletion and navigation
- **Self-documenting code**: Type definitions serve as documentation
- **Easier refactoring**: The type system helps ensure correctness when making changes
- **Interface definitions**: Clear contracts between components
- **Code navigation**: Easier to understand the codebase structure

### Negative

- **Learning curve**: Team members need to learn TypeScript if not already familiar
- **Build step**: TypeScript requires compilation, adding complexity to the build process
- **Migration effort**: Existing code needs to be migrated to TypeScript
- **Potential over-engineering**: TypeScript can lead to overly complex type hierarchies if not carefully managed

### Mitigation Strategies

- Gradually migrate existing code while adding new features in TypeScript
- Use TypeScript's allowJs option to mix JavaScript and TypeScript during transition
- Create a style guide for TypeScript usage to prevent over-engineering
- Start with basic types and interfaces, then refine as needed

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
2. Add build scripts to package.json
3. Begin with core domain models in TypeScript
4. Gradually convert existing benchmarks as they're enhanced
5. Update tests to use TypeScript

## Alternative Options Considered

### Option 1: Continue with JavaScript + JSDoc

We considered using JavaScript with JSDoc comments to add type information. This would provide some type checking benefits without changing the language.

**Pros**:
- No compilation step
- Easier transition

**Cons**:
- Less robust type checking
- Type information separate from code
- Limited IDE support compared to TypeScript

### Option 2: Flow

Flow is a static type checker for JavaScript that could provide similar benefits to TypeScript.

**Pros**:
- Designed to work with JavaScript
- Incremental adoption possible

**Cons**:
- Smaller community and ecosystem compared to TypeScript
- Less comprehensive IDE support
- Facebook's reduced focus on Flow in recent years
