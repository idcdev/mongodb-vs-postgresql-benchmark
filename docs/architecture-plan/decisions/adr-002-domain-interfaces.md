# ADR-002: Domain Interfaces Design

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As part of our hexagonal architecture implementation, we need to define how the domain layer will interact with external components through well-defined interfaces. The design of these interfaces is critical as they will serve as the contracts between the core domain and the adapters that connect to external systems.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive set of domain interfaces following these principles:

1. **Complete Isolation**: The domain will have no dependencies on external frameworks or implementations.
2. **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces will be focused and specific rather than general-purpose.
3. **Explicit Documentation**: All interfaces and methods will have clear documentation.
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript will be used to enforce type constraints at compile time.

The following domain interfaces will be created:

1. **Database Interfaces**
   - `DatabaseAdapter`: Core interface for database operations
   - `ConnectionOptions`: Configuration for database connections

2. **Benchmark Interfaces**
   - `Benchmark`: Interface for individual benchmarks
   - `BenchmarkService`: Service for managing and executing benchmarks
   - `BaseBenchmark`: Abstract class implementing common benchmark functionality

3. **Configuration Interfaces**
   - `ConfigProvider`: Interface for accessing configuration from various sources

4. **Event Interfaces**
   - `EventEmitter`: Interface for event-based communication

5. **Service Interfaces**
   - `LoggerService`: Interface for logging
   - `ReportService`: Interface for generating reports
   - `DataService`: Interface for test data generation and management
   - `MetricsService`: Interface for collecting and analyzing metrics
   - `ValidationService`: Interface for data validation
   - `StorageService`: Interface for data persistence

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Clear Boundaries**: The interfaces establish clear boundaries between components.
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation with mock implementations.
- **Flexibility**: New implementations can be added without changing the domain code.
- **Documentation**: The interfaces serve as self-documenting contracts.

### Negative

- **Development Overhead**: Creating and maintaining interfaces adds development time.
- **Potential Over-engineering**: There's a risk of creating too many interfaces.
- **Learning Curve**: New developers will need to understand the interface design.

### Mitigation Strategies

- Focus on essential interfaces first
- Refactor and consolidate interfaces as patterns emerge
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Use TypeScript to enforce interface contracts

## Implementation Details

All interfaces will be placed in the `src/core/domain/interfaces` directory, with each interface in its own file:

```
src/core/domain/interfaces/
├── database-adapter.interface.ts
├── benchmark.interface.ts
├── benchmark-service.interface.ts
├── config-provider.interface.ts
├── event-emitter.interface.ts
├── logger.interface.ts
├── report-service.interface.ts
├── data-service.interface.ts
├── metrics-service.interface.ts
├── validation-service.interface.ts
└── storage-service.interface.ts
```

Domain models will be placed in `src/core/domain/model`:

```
src/core/domain/model/
├── benchmark-options.ts
├── benchmark-result.ts
└── base-benchmark.ts
```

Barrel files (`index.ts`) will be created at various levels to simplify imports.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Minimal Interfaces

Create only the essential interfaces (Database, Benchmark) and add others as needed.

**Pros**:
- Faster initial development
- Less upfront design work

**Cons**:
- Risk of inconsistent design as interfaces are added incrementally
- Potential rework as patterns emerge later

### Option 2: Framework-specific Interfaces

Create interfaces that are more tightly coupled to specific implementations.

**Pros**:
- More straightforward implementation
- Faster development for specific use cases

**Cons**:
- Less flexibility for changing implementations
- Tighter coupling to external frameworks
