# MongoDB vs PostgreSQL Benchmark - Master Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for overhauling the MongoDB vs PostgreSQL Benchmark project architecture and features.

## Project Objectives

- Redesign the project architecture to follow best practices and design patterns
- Enhance the benchmark framework to be more extensible and maintainable
- Add new features to provide more comprehensive benchmarking capabilities
- Improve visualization and reporting of benchmark results
- Create robust documentation for users and contributors

## Implementation Phases

- [ ] Implement configuration validation

#### 1.3 Benchmark Framework
- [ ] Create abstract classes and interfaces for benchmarks
- [ ] Implement plugin system for dynamically loading benchmarks
- [ ] Develop event system for component communication
