# Phase 1: Foundation Architectural Redesign

This document details the implementation plan and final status of Phase 1 of the MongoDB vs PostgreSQL Benchmark project.

## Folder Structure

The new core folder structure is as follows:

```
src/
├── core/
│   ├── domain/              # Domain models and business logic
│   │   ├── model/           # Core domain entities
│   │   ├── service/         # Domain services
│   │   └── interfaces/      # Domain interfaces
│   ├── application/         # Application services
│   │   ├── benchmark/       # Benchmark services
│   │   ├── config/          # Configuration services
│   │   ├── database/        # Database adapters
│   │   └── events/          # Event system
│   └── infrastructure/      # Technical implementations
│       ├── cli/             # Command line interface
│       └── report/          # Report generation
```

## Implemented Components

### Domain Interfaces
- [x] `DatabaseAdapter` - Interface for database operations
- [x] `BenchmarkService` - Interface for benchmark operations
- [x] `EventEmitter` - Interface for event handling
- [x] `ConfigProvider` - Interface for configuration management
- [x] `CLIHandler` - Interface for command-line operations
- [x] `ReportService` - Interface for report generation

### Domain Models
- [x] `BenchmarkOptions` - Model for benchmark configuration
- [x] `BenchmarkResult` - Model for benchmark results
- [x] `BaseBenchmark` - Abstract base class for benchmarks

### Application Layer Components
- [x] `DefaultConfigProvider` - Implementation of configuration provider
- [x] `ConfigFactory` - Factory for creating configuration providers
- [x] `DefaultEventEmitter` - Implementation of event emitter
- [x] `MongoDBAdapter` - Adapter for MongoDB operations
- [x] `PostgreSQLAdapter` - Adapter for PostgreSQL operations
- [x] `DefaultBenchmarkService` - Service for executing benchmarks

### Infrastructure Layer Components
- [x] `DefaultCLIHandler` - Implementation of command-line interface handler
- [x] `DefaultReportService` - Implementation of report generation service

## Testing Strategy

The testing approach for Phase 1 included:

1. Unit tests for core components
2. Integration tests for adapter implementations
3. End-to-end tests for basic benchmark execution

Code coverage target: >80% for core domain and application layers

## Dependencies

- TypeScript for type safety
- Jest for testing
- Config library for configuration management
- EventEmitter2 for advanced event handling

## Current Progress

**Phase 1 Status:** 100% Complete

Phase 1 has successfully established the architectural foundation for the project, implementing all planned components and establishing a solid base for subsequent phases. All initial objectives have been achieved, including:

1. Establishment of a well-defined hexagonal architecture
2. Implementation of database adapters for MongoDB and PostgreSQL
3. Creation of a flexible event system
4. Development of a comprehensive benchmark service
5. Implementation of a CLI handler and report generator

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 completed, the next steps are:

1. Update the CLI entry point to use the new architecture
2. Add integration tests for all components working together
3. Create example benchmarks for common database operations
4. Begin implementation of Phase 2 with standard benchmarks
